# Why this new
# AI-Based Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge?
The capital city of Dhaka has only 7% traffic roads (compared to 25% urban standard) in presence of approximately 8 million commuters a day within 306 sq km area. The scenario of Dhaka traffic is unique which poses complex new challenges in terms of automated traffic detection. To solve the problem using advances in AI-based technology and ICT solutions, we are calling for solutions to automatic Dhaka traffic detection problems on optical images. This new AI-Based Dhaka Traffic Detection Challenge aims at assessing the ability of state-of-the-art methods to detect and recognize traffic vehicles. This solution is encountered in modern cities where multiple cultures live and communicate together, where users see various scripts and languages in a way that prevents using much a priori knowledge. Also, at the same time, academics and researchers from the region who are experts in AI or interested in exploring possibilities could be brought to a networking community through this campaign. Working together on a common problem statement can create the right synergies needed to build an AI-based community in South-East Asia.
